## Summary
The Doggo App allows you to book a walk for your dog from local walkers. Browse local walkers, check out their feedback from other users, and book when ready.

As a walker, you can list your services on the Doggo app. You can review requests for walk services on your account page, accept or decline them, and mark them as complete then the walk is done.
