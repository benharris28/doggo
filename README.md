## Summary
The Doggo App allows you to book a walk for your dog from local walkers. Browse local walkers, check out their feedback from other users, and book when ready.

As a walker, you can list your services on the Doggo app. You can review requests for walk services on your account page, accept or decline them, and mark them as complete then the walk is done.

## Technologies Used
The client application is built with React and Javascript. The client app also uses a direct signature upload for images to AWS S3.

The server application is built on Node JS, Express Server, and Postgres database. The server is hosted on Heroku.
